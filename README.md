Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirement was to choose an app from a list. I had chosen the InventoryApp, but I could not get it to work right. I was first trying to create the login, and I wanted to make 
it where an array would load the values to compare to the user's entry.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The screens needed would be the login screen and the item display screen. The login screen was fairly minimalist; it had a text field for the user name, and one for the password, and a submit button. The display screen would have been pretty simplistic as well just to make it user friendly.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

My approach was to first design the login and add features incrementally so that I could detect errors as they happen. I will keep this approach, but I do not think I am familiar enough with this type of programming. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I would add a feature, build and then run. This process would reveal errors both at compile time and run time.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
My biggest challenge is that with other applications of Java, I try to make things more object oriented, and designing an app seems more procedural. The inclusion of XML files seems to throw me off a bit.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Reading the text fields and the button for presses was successful. I still need to figure out why the database could not be created.
